This repository contains the scripts which were used to build cline models which incorporated data from environmental variables taken from _Littorina saxatilis_ hybrid zones. Their are two folders, `/analysis_scripts` and `/plots` which contain revalent scripts to recreate the results. The original data for these hybrid zones was first published in [Westram et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1002/evl3.74) and [Westram et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15861).

This project has been submitted for peer review to the Journal of Evolutionary Biology.
